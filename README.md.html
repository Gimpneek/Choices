Choices
=======
*A PHP library that makes dealing with the NHS Choices API easier.*

Choices was created by Colin Wren as a tool to help even the playing field when dealing with the NHS Choices API. There seems to be inconsistent data formats and pages of data. This library turns it all into JSON and will go through every page for you.

Choices is still in it's infancy and currently only looks around for organisations around a 'place'. This will eventually progress to all the features present on the NHS Choices syndication website meaning you should be able to drop Choices into your project and access all of NHS Choices through a couple of calls.

NHS Choices API use and attribution
-----------------------------------
To use the Choices library you will first need to supply it with an NHS Choices API key. You can get an API key from the [NHS Choices syndication page](http://www.nhs.uk/aboutNHSChoices/professionals/syndication/Pages/Webservices.aspx "Grab an API key"). You will then need to set this key when calling a new instance of Choices otherwise Choices won't work.

When using NHS Choices content you need to show that you're using their data. Choices takes this into consideration and includes a function that will print out the attribution image and if supplied with a page URL will add this to the link.
